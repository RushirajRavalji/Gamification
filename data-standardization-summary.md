# Solo Legend Data Flow Standardization

## Summary of Changes

I've implemented a comprehensive set of changes to standardize how data flows through the Solo Legend application, fixing inconsistencies in how character data, XP, levels, and other elements are handled. Here's a breakdown of the key improvements:

### 1. Centralized Character Data Loading

- The dashboard layout now uses the `useCharacter` hook instead of directly querying Firestore
- All component pages now use the same character data source
- Eliminated separate data loading logic in each component, reducing code duplication
- Ensured character data is loaded only once and shared consistently

### 2. Firebase Integration

- Updated all pages to load real data from Firebase instead of using mock data
- Implemented proper Firebase updates for all user actions
- Added proper error handling and loading states
- Ensured all timestamps are handled correctly across components

### 3. Skills Page Improvements

- Created a custom `SkillNode` interface for the skill tree that properly extends the base `Skill` type
- Implemented real skill point calculations based on character level
- Added functionality to upgrade skills that updates both UI and Firebase
- Implemented skill reset functionality with proper stats resets
- Fixed skill requirements validation

### 4. Inventory Page Improvements

- Replaced mock items with real inventory data from Firebase
- Implemented item equip/unequip functionality with Firebase integration
- Added filtering by item type with tabs
- Implemented consumable item usage
- Added calculation of total stat boosts from equipped items

### 5. XP Journal Page Improvements

- Loaded real journal entries from Firebase instead of mock data
- Added proper timestamp handling and sorting for journal entries
- Improved stat calculations based on real journal data
- Added safeguards for empty data states

### 6. Type Safety Improvements

- Added proper TypeScript interfaces for all data structures
- Fixed type inconsistencies throughout the app
- Added nullable checks to prevent runtime errors
- Implemented proper Firestore data conversion to TypeScript types

## Key Benefits

1. **Consistency** - All components now display the same character data
2. **Reliability** - User progress is properly saved to Firebase
3. **Performance** - Reduced unnecessary data fetching
4. **Maintainability** - Centralized data logic makes future updates easier
5. **User Experience** - Real-time feedback for user actions

The application now provides a consistent experience across all features, with character progression properly tracked and displayed throughout the platform.
